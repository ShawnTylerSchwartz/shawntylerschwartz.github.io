#### Biographical Sketch
My general research interests are centered around designing deep learning algorithms and machine learning applications to solve problems related to big data in the scope of comparative macroevolutionary biology. I am also interested in studying differences and deficits for visuospatial memory and misinformation effects in younger adults. I am passionate about engaging with and developing innovative, novel technologies, and have been actively involved with the development of innovative medical software and educational technologies to enhance both the 21st century hospital and classroom experiences.

I'm very passionate about giving back to the community through volunteer outreach and social justice advocacy. Having spent over 1,300 hours of volunteered time in the hospital and clinical settings, I value the importance of meaningful, personal-interactions as well as spending time with my family, friends, and colleagues.

I have held numerous technical leadership positions, such as being the lead student web developer for Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) for over 3 years, where I wrote thousands of lines of code designing and building new software tools for UCLA students and faculty. I have also written custom software for UCLA Health, and helped develop software for the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCLA that allows students to interactively visualize 3D molecules in a large lecture setting (https://qrchem.net).

In 2014, I co-founded an organization, Back Off Bully, which promotes anti-bullying awareness through school assemblies and conferences along with the not-for-profit sales of bracelets in which the proceeds go directly to Nancy Cartwright's (the voice of Bart Simpson) Happy House Foundation.
